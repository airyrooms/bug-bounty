# Airy Bug Bounty

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I found a vulnerability, but I don't know how to exploit it?**

**A:** We expect that vulnerability reports sent to us have a valid attack scenario to qualify for a reward, and we consider it as a critical step when doing vulnerability research. Reward amounts are decided based on the maximum impact of the vulnerability, and the panel is willing to reconsider a reward amount, based on new information (such as a chain of bugs, or a revised attack scenario).

**Q: Who determines whether my report is eligible for a reward?**

**A:** The reward panel consists of the members of the Airy Security Team.

**Q: When will reward be paid?**

**A:** You will be paid after the vulnerabilty has been fixed by our engineer. So give us reasonable time to fix it.

**Q: What happens if I disclose the bug publicly before you had a chance to fix it?**

A: Please read our [General Guideline](./General-Guideline.md). In essence, our pledge to you is to respond promptly and fix bugs in a sensible timeframe - and in exchange, we ask for a reasonable advance notice. Reports that go against this principle will usually not qualify, and we cancel the reward. And if it contains sensitive information, it doesn't close the possibility to litigate by applicable laws.
